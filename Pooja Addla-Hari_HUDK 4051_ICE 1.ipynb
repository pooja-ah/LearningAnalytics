    "\n",
    "### Simple filtering of numeric values \n",
    "\n",
    "The WHERE clause can also be used to filter numeric records, such as years or ages.\n",

    "### WHERE IN \n",

    "### Introduction to NULL and IS NULL \n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, NULL represents a missing or unknown value. We can check for NULL values using the expression IS NULL. For example, to count the number of missing birth dates in the people table:\n",

    "As you can see, IS NULL is useful when combined with WHERE to figure out what data you're missing. Sometimes, we'll want to filter out missing values so you only get results which are not NULL. To do this, we can use the IS NOT NULL operator.\n",

    "For example, this query gives the names of all people whose birth dates are not missing in the people table.\n",

    "The WHERE clause can be used to filter text data. However, so far we've only been able to filter by specifying the exact text we're interested in. In the real world, often we'll want to search for a pattern rather than a specific text string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, the LIKE operator can be used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column. To accomplish this, we use something called a wildcard as a placeholder for some other values. There are two wildcards we can use with LIKE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The % wildcard will match zero, one, or many characters in text. For example, the following query matches companies like 'Data', 'DataC' 'DataCamp', 'DataMind', and so on:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT name\n",
    "FROM companies\n",

    "### A note on arithmetic \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to using aggregate functions, we can perform basic arithmetic with symbols like +, -, *, and /.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, this gives a result of 12:\n",
    "`SELECT (4 * 3);`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the following gives a result of 1:\n",
    "`SELECT (4 / 3);`\n",
    "\n",
    "What's going on here? SQL assumes that if you divide an integer by an integer, you want to get an integer back. So be careful when dividing. If you want more precision when dividing, you can add decimal places to your numbers. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT (4.0 / 3.0) AS result;`\n",
    "\n",
    "gives you the result you would expect: 1.333.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It's AS simple AS aliasing \n",
    "In the first exercise of this chapter, the column name of our result was just the name of the function we used. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT MAX(budget)\n",
    "FROM films;`\n",
    "gives you a result with one column, named max. But what if you use two functions like this?\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT MAX(budget), MAX(duration)\n",
    "FROM films;`\n",
    "Well, then you'd have two columns named max, which isn't very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid situations like this, SQL allows us to do something called aliasing. Aliasing simply means we assign a temporary name to something. To alias, we use the AS keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the above example we could use aliases to make the result clearer:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT MAX(budget) AS max_budget,\n",
    "       MAX(duration) AS max_duration\n",
    "FROM films;`\n",
    "\n",

    "### Even more aliasing \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: SQL assumes that if you divide an integer by an integer, you want to get an integer back. This means that the following will erroneously result in 400.0:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT 45 / 10 * 100.0;\n",
    "This is because 45 / 10 evaluates to an integer (4), and not a decimal number like we would expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you're dividing make sure at least one of your numbers has a decimal place:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT 45 * 100.0 / 10;\n",
    "The above now gives the correct answer of 450.0 since the numerator (45 * 100.0) of the division is now a decimal!\n",
